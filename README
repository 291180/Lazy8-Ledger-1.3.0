COMPILING LAZY8LEDGER FROM SOURCE

To compile lazy8ledger, you will need:

- Jakarta Ant. I use version 1.4; older versions might or might not
  work. Get it from <http://jakarta.apache.org>.
- jedit.jar and InfoViewer.jar in the ../../ directory
- This must be compiled with java 1.4 however, it can be run in java 1.3
