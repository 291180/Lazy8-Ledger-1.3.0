<br><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+4>Account entry form</font></font></b>
<br>Here is where you enter your Accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, you might
need to do some thing before you begin entering accounts here.&nbsp; If
the company you want to enter accounts on does not show up on the form,
you must go to another form and enter the company number and name you are
going to work with.&nbsp; If this is your case, Go to the menu DataEntry-><a href="company.en.html">Company</a>
<p>The accounts you enter should be from some sort of standard accounting
system .&nbsp; For all examples here, we use the EU BAS 2000 account plan.&nbsp;
You are free to use any accounting system or make up your own.
<br>&nbsp;
<h1><a name="company"></a>
Company</h1>
Choose here which company you want to work with.&nbsp; Most users will
have only one company to work with and in such a case then there should
be no selection necessary and the company will come here automatically
and in such a case this field will even be disabled so you wont be able
to choose a company.&nbsp; Please see <a href="setup.en.html">SETUP&nbsp;</a>
for more information on how to choose a default company and <a href="company.en.html">Company</a>
to see how to enter more companies.
<br>&nbsp;
<h1><a name="number"></a>
Account number</h1>
This is an integer number that should come from some accepted accounting
system.&nbsp; The EU BAS 2000 system uses 4 digit numbers.&nbsp; It is a
good idea to give all your account numbers the same number of digits but
there is no requirement for this program to work.&nbsp; This number must
be uniq for just this account you are entering for this particular company.
<h1><a name="name"></a>
Account name</h1>
This can be any information you want.&nbsp; Usually it appropriately describes
the account.
<h1><a name="asset"></a>
Capital or debts</h1>
It is extreamly important that this check box is used correctly.&nbsp;
All accounts that are capital,loans, or inventory should have this box
checked.&nbsp; All accounts that are incomes or expendatures should not
have this box checked.&nbsp; This information is vital for doing the year
end results.
