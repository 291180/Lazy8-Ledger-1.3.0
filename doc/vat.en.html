<br><font size=+4>VAT report</font>
<br>This report is basically only to produce figures for the Swedish Momsdeklaration and
also only if you use the EU BAS 2000 account system.  However, you can change this report to suit
your needs. See Advanced->Report-><a
href="sumrep.en.html">Special report</a>.  The name of this report when you use <a
href="sumrep.en.html">Special report</a> is 'VAT.en'</p>
<h1>
Company</h1>
This report will only do one company at a time.&nbsp; So, you must choose
the company to printout on here.&nbsp; If you have only one company and
have choosen to not be able to change the company (see Options-><a href="setup.en.html">SETUP</a>)
then this will be disabled and you dont need to do anything here.
<h1>
Start date</h1>
This report will print all transaction in the accounts between the given start
and stop date where the start and stop date will be applied to the Invoice
date field you entered in DataEntry-><a href="transaction.en.html">Transaction</a>.&nbsp;
There must exist records bettween these two dates, otherwise there will
be no report.
<h1>
Stop date</h1>
This report will print all transaction in the accounts between the given start
and stop date where the start and stop date will be applied to the Invoice
date field you entered in DataEntry-><a href="transaction.en.html">Transaction</a>.&nbsp;
There must exist records bettween these two dates, otherwise there will
be no report.
<h1>
Report title</h1>
This is the title of the report that will only appear at the top of the
report.&nbsp; This could be blank if you wish
<h1>
Get report Button</h1>
Press this button when all the previous fields are entered.&nbsp; The report
will appear in a seperate word processing window
<h1>
Get report into clipboard Button</h1>
Press this button when all the previous fields are entered.&nbsp; The report
will be directly put onto the clipboard.  You must then paste the report
into some other wordprocessor or spreadsheet.  If you paste into a wordprocessor,
then you will attain the best results if after you have pasted into the
wordprocessor, that you select the entire report and then select -convert
to table- in the wordprocessing program</a>
<br><br><br>This report is especially wide so I would suggest you make the word
processing window as wide as possible, otherwise word wrapping will ruin
how the report looks.
